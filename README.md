# Competitive Programming

A collection of my competitive programming solutions written in **C++** and **Python**.  
The repository includes practice problems and contest submissions from platforms such as **Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, HackerRank,** and others.

## Topics Covered
- Data Structures (arrays, strings, graphs, etc.)  
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy, graph algorithms)  
- Mathematics and Number Theory  
- Advanced problem-solving techniques  

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to:
- Track my progress in competitive programming  
- Share my approaches to different problem types  
- Provide reference implementations for other learners in competitive programming
